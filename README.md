## About

I have been working on AngularJS project for last couple of months. One of my assignments was to implement custom form builder that allows system admins to create custom forms, and allows users to view created forms, fill them and submit the data. 

It took sometime to finish this task. While doing it, I had to make 100+ searches on Google, spend couple of days, and read a lot of stuff. So, I decided to create an open-source project and share my knowledge on this issue.

## Dependencies
* AngularJS 1.0.7+
* Bootstrap 2.3.2+
* Grunt (to build the project) 0.4.1+
* Bower

## Installing Modules

* First you need to install node_modules. Cd to repository folder.  ``` $cd angularjs-form-builder ```

* Execute ``` $sudo npm install ```

* Then execute ``` $sudo bower install ```

## Launching the App

* Change directory to app folder  ``` $cd app ```

* Now, you can start the grunt server: ``` $grunt server ```

* It will open the AngularJS app in your default browser.
